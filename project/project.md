## Abstract

The project involves analyzing the relationships of various cryptocurrencies with Foreign Exchange Rates and Stock Market Indices. Apart from analyzing the relationships, the objective of the project is also to estimate the trend of the cryptocurrencies based on Foreign Exchange Rates and Stock Market Indices. We will be using historic data of 17 different cryptocurrencies, 21 Stock Market Indices and 22 Foreign Exchange Rates for this project. The project will use various Machine Learning models for analysis and prediction. The project might also use Neural Networks for prediction and estimation.

## 1. Introduction
One of the latest global medium of exchange is Cryptocurrency. The total market capitalizations of all cryptocurrencies added up to $237.1 Billion as of 2019[<sup>[1]</sup>](https://www.statista.com/statistics/730876/cryptocurrency-maket-value/#:~:text=Cryptocurrency%20market%20capitalization%202013%2D2019&text=The%20cumulative%20market%20capitalization%20of,below%2018%20billion%20U.S.%20dollars.). Cryptocurrency systems do not require a central authority, its state is maintained through distributed consensus[<sup>[2]</sup>](http://si-journal.org/index.php/JSI/article/viewFile/335/325). Therefore, determine the factors affecting the prices of cryptocurrencies becomes difficult. There are many factors affecting cryptocurrency like transaction cost, reward system, hash rate, coins circulation, forks, popularity of cryptomarket, speculations, stock markets, exchange rates, gold price, interest rate, legalization and restriction[<sup>[3]</sup>](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3125347). This project involves analysis of relationships of various cryptocurrencies with Foreign Exchange Rates and Stock Market Indices.

## 2. Dataset
The project will use the historic data of Stock Market Indices - NASDAQ 100, S&P 500, Dow Jones, DAX, BEL 20, AEX, S&P/TSX 60, IGPA, Merval 25, SMI, IBEX 35, FTSE Italia A, CAC 40, EURO STOXX 50, FTSE 100, RTS, Shanghai Comp, NIKKEI 225, Hang Seng, S&P ASX 20 and Foreign Exhange Rates with USD of currencies - Australian Dollar, Euro, New Zealand Dollar, British Pound, Brazilian Real, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong Dollar, Indian Rupee, Korean Won, Mexican Peso, South African Rand, Singapore Dollar, Danish Krone, Japanese Yen, Malaysian Ringgit, Norwegian Krone, Swedish Krona, Sri Lankan Rupee, Swiss Franc, New Taiwan Dollar and Thai Baht. This data will be used to analyze its relationships with various cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Bitconnect, Dash, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Iota, Litecoin, Monero, Nem, Neo, Numeraire, Omisego, Qtum, Ripple, Stratis and Waves.

Cryptocurrency dataset[<sup>[4]</sup>](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrencypricehistory?select=bitconnect_price.csv) and Foriegn Exchange Rate dataset[<sup>[5]</sup>](https://www.kaggle.com/brunotly/foreign-exchange-rates-per-dollar-20002019), both, available on Kaggle will be used for this project. The historic data for various stock market indices will be taken from multiple sources and are still to be decided.
